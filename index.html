                    <p>
                        Aladdin and Vinny were the best good boys the world has ever known. 
                        Aladdin, the gentle big brother, carried himself with grace, always watching over his mischievous little brother. 
                        Vinny, a little agent of chaos, always with something to say, filled every room with energy and noise—
                        especially when there was something to sink his claws into. 
                        They spent their days play-fighting, napping in the sun, and filling our home with love.

                        This page is for them: two brothers, inseparable in life and forever in our hearts.
