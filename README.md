# Odin Landing Page

A simple website landing page, built as my solution to The Odin Project's [Project: Landing Page](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page), and as a tribute to the two best boys the world has ever known: Aladdin and Vinny.

## New skills used

- HTML: semantic elements (i.e. nav, header, footer, etc.)
- CSS: custom fonts, colours and styling, pseudo-classes (i.e. button:hover), box-model
- Flexbox: alignment and spacing, flow direction, flexible sizing, responsive behaviour, nested flex containers
